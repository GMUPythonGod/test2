Data cleaning, null removal, datatype conversion, column renaming, mathematical transformation, blending, merging, joining with multiple data sources are some of the transformation tasks that can be performed over data created within Momentum. Anything that is supported by ANSI-standard SQL can be performed using Momentum\u2019s transformation engine. A multi-level SQL based transformation is a powerful way of performing complex transformation tasks involving single or multiple data sources.\u00a0 \nIn this section we will explore how to perform a single SQL-based as well as multi-step transformations.\u00a0 \nSingle Step Transformer\u00a0 \nIn the following example, binary formatted date is transformed into human readable date using standard SQL.

The steps are as follows.\u00a0 \nCreating Training and Test Sets Using Transformer\u00a0 \nThere are many ways to create training and test sets from the dataset we ingested. This section demonstrates how to use SQL compliant transformer to create the two sets for machine learning training and test.\u00a0 \nAssuming we want to create 80% training and 20% test sets from the original 10,000 records. We also want to randomize the data so that the training and test sets are not biased. We will create two transformers:\u00a0 \nCreating Training Set\u00a0 \nHere are the steps to create the training set:\u00a0 \nSELECT * FROM tr.sansari.machine_data_transformer order by RAND() limit 8000\u00a0 \nListing 2: Transformer SQL to generate training set\u00a0 \nFigure 2.8: Transformer to create training set\u00a0 \nNotice that the transformer page shows a list of data sources on the right-side panel. You can click on any data item to see the data in tabular form. This view is provided to give an aid to the user while writing the SQL statements for the transformer.\u00a0 \nCreating Test Set\u00a0 \nThis section demonstrates a multi-step transformation process, a powerful way of transforming complex data into meaningful forms. Here are the steps to create the test set:\u00a0 \nSELECT * FROM tr.sansari.machine_data_transformer\u00a0 \nListing 3: SQL statement to load all the data from a transformer\u00a0 \nSELECT * FROM tr.sansari.machine_data_training_set\u00a0 \nListing 4: SQL statement to load transformer data that created training set\u00a0 \nselect * from s1 minus select * from s2\u00a0 \nListing 5: SQL statement to perform MINUS operation\u00a0 \nThe following Figure 2.9 shows the three SQL statements as you will see in Momentum Transformer page.\u00a0 \nFigure 2.9: Multi-step transformer to create test set\u00a0 \nNotes:\u00a0"

To keep Momentum data warehouse, Impulse, as an independent system, it is also treated as an external system. In other words, data from the lake needs to be exported to Impulse like any other external system.\u00a0 \nThis section explains how to configure an emitter that can be attached to a data pipeline (see Setting Up Data Pipeline section) to automate the data ingestion, transformation and export via emitter to external system.\u00a0 \nTo configure an emitter:\u00a0 \nOverwrite: delete all previous records and recreate new set of records\u00a0Append: create new rows and append to existing dataset\u00a0Combine and Overwrite: Combine new data with the old ones and then overwrite.\u00a0Incremental: Update existing rows if matching primary key is found else create a new row.\u00a0 \nEmitter does not independently run.

Similarly, data created by other components, such as transformer, machine learning, or NLP, can be explored.\u00a0 \nFigure 2.12 : Data exploration result\u00a0 \nViewing and Analyzing Data\u00a0 \nExpand the output components, e.g. the \u201cIngester Output\u201d and click the data component (e.g ingester) you want to explore. This will show 100 records of the data. To show more rows, edit the SQL query shown in the text area and click the \u2018blue button\u2019 next to it to run the updated SQL. For example, changing the LIMIT 200 will show 200 rows, \u2018LIMIT all\u2019 will show all the data (\u2018Limit all\u2019 may crash your browser if there is a lot of data). The following Figure 2.13 shows the SQL and data rows.\u00a0 \nFigure 2.13: Data view and corresponding SQL\u00a0 \nAlternatively, you can use Interactive Query to perform ad hoc analysis as described below.\u00a0 \nAd hoc Analysis Using Interactive Query\u00a0 \nInteractive Query is a powerful data exploration tool that allows you to execute any ANSI-SQL compliant query over data available within Momentum.\u00a0\u00a0 \nData within Momentum is organized within the component that generates them. The organization structure is analogous to RDBMS structure in the sense that component name is treated as a database and data generated from various sources as tables of that database. For example, Ingester generated data are organized within \u201cIngester Output\u201d aliased as \u201cio\u201d. The data tables within the Ingester Output are referenced using fully qualified name as \u201cio.<username>.<tablename>\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 \nFor example: to explore the machine data to count number of records by Machine_failure, we run the following Interactive Query as shown in Figure 2.14\u00a0below.\u00a0 \nSELECT AVG(VIBRATION), NC_MODE FROM io.ai.cnc_historical_data GROUP BY NC_MODE\u00a0 \nListing 1: Sample SQL statement to count by Machine_failure\u00a0 \nFigure 2.14: Example Interactive Query with sample output\u00a0 \nVisual Analysis\u00a0 \nVisual analysis allows us to plot data to understand the data distribution, outliers, trend, and overall quality of the data. To perform visual analysis, click on \u201cData Upload & Exploration\u201d and do the following:\u00a0 \nFigure 2.15\u00a0Red circle to indicate the graph icon to launch the plot configuration window.\u00a0 \nFigure 2.16: Config example for plotting histogram\u00a0 \nFigure 2.17: An example output of histogram plots\u00a0 \nDownloading Data for Offline Exploration\u00a0 \nNote that, depending on the amount of data, it may take a while to generate and download the data from the cluster\u2019s distributed lake to your local computer.\u00a0"
